        <p class=" p-10 ">Checkers, also called draughts, board game, one of the world’s oldest games.
          Checkers is played by two persons who oppose each other across a board of 64 light and dark squares, the same
          as a chessboard. The 24 playing pieces are disk-shaped and of contrasting colours (whatever their colours,
          they are identified as black and white). At the start of the game, each contestant has 12 pieces arranged on
          the board. While the actual playing is always done on the dark squares, the board is often shown in reverse
          for clarity. The notation used in describing the game is based on numbering the squares on the board. The
          black pieces always occupy squares 1 to 12, and the white pieces invariably rest on squares 21 to 32.</p>

          <div class="flex content-start justify-around flex-wrap ">
            <p class="w-1/2 p-5"> Checkers is played on a standard 64 square board. Only the 32 dark colored squares are
              used in play. Each player begins the game with 12 pieces, or checkers, placed in the three rows closest to
              him or her.
              The object of the game is to capture all of your opponent’s checkers or position your pieces so that your
              opponent has no available moves.</p>

            <p class="w-1/2 p-5"> Basic movement is to move a checker one space diagonally forward. You can not move a
              checker backwards until it becomes a King, as described below. If a jump is available, you must take the
              jump, as described in the next question and answer.</p>

          <div class="flex content-start justify-around flex-wrap ">
            <div class="w-1/2 p-2">
              <p class="p-1"> If one of your opponent’s checkers is on a forward diagonal next to one of your checkers,
                and the next space beyond the opponent’s checker is empty, then your checker must jump the opponent’s
                checker and land in the space beyond. Your opponent’s checker is captured and removed from the board.
              </p>
              <p class="p-1">After making one jump, your checker might have another jump available from its new
                position.
                Your checker must take that jump too. It must continue to jump until there are no more jumps available.
                Both men and kings are allowed to make multiple jumps.</p>
              <p class="p-1">If, at the start of a turn, more than one of your checkers has a jump available, then you
                may
                decide which one you will move. But once you have chosen one, it must take all the jumps that it can.

              <p class="p-1">If a jump is available for one of your pieces, you must make that jump. If more jumps are
                available with that same piece, you must continue to jump with it until it can jump no more. To make the
                second and third jump with a piece, you do not need to click that piece again. Just click the next space
                to which it will jump.</p>
              <p class="p-1">If more than one of your pieces has a jump available at the start of your turn, you can
                choose which piece you will move. But then you must make all the jumps available for that piece.</p>

                <p class="p-1">When one of your checkers reaches the opposite side of the board, it is crowned and

                <p class="p-1">A King can move backward as well as forward along the diagonals. It can only move a
                  distance
                  of one space.</p>
                <p class="p-1">A King can also jump backward and forward. It must jump when possible, and it must take
                  all
                  jumps that are available to it. In each jump, the King can only jump over one opposing piece at a
                  time,
                  and it must land in the space just beyond the captured piece. The King can not move multiple spaces
                  before
                  or after jumping a piece.</p>
