## Using It
Play by selecting your piece and clicking on the tile you want to move to. Click [here](http://www.itsyourturn.com/t_helptopic2030.html) to learn how to play checkers. Jumping when available is enforced.

## Code
The code supports all the features of checkers including kingship and double/triple/quadruple jumping. The Board object controls the board and therefore the game. The pieces and tiles instances are used in the game for checking whether a piece can be moved, moving a piece, deleting a piece, checking whether tile is in range, and much more. The script is fully commented and original.
